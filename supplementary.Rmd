## Industrial activities

We selected six industrial activities with proven detrimental impacts on ocean ecosystems: industrial fishing, the presence of non-publicly tracked fishing vessels through AIS, marine artifical structures (MAS) including oil and gas installations, offshore wind farms or aquaculture farms, dredging and marine aggregate extraction, desalination plants, maritime ports [@grorud2021mpa]. We also calculate the presence and extent of maritime shipping and transport in each cell, and human gravity. Both of these are not considered as industrial activities in this study, but they're presence could still be detrimental to marine biodiversity and MPA effectiveness. The full procedure to obtain all industrial activities is desribed in the supplementary material. 

### Industrial fishing

According to the IUCN, industrial fishing states that "in the context of protected areas, industrial fishing is defined as (\>12 m long x 6 m wide) motorised vessels" [@iucn2020066]. In the EU, all fishing vessels larger than 15m are required to broadcast their position using the Automatic Identification System (AIS). Following this definition, all fishing vessels broadcasting AIS can therefore be considered as industrial fishing in the context of protected areas.

Therefore, in order to estimate industrial fishing in each grid cell, we used fishing effort estimated by Global Fishing Watch through Automatic Identification System (AIS) during the 2023 period, at a daily resolution of 0.01Â° [@kroodsma2018tracking]. Using the European registry of fishing vessels, we only kept fishing vessels with a declared gear to avoid wrong classifications of non-fishing vessels as fishing vessels. In each cell, we calculated the presence of fishing as a binary variable, the sum of fishing hours (all gears confounded) in 2023 and the fishing density (number of fishing hours per km\^2). We also calculated the mean length of fishing vessels and the number of different fishing vessels in each cell.

### Untracked fishing vessels

Although all fishing vessels in the EU are required to broadcast their position using AIS, some fishing vessels may disable or tamper with their AIS device in order to avoid detection. These vessels can be detected using satellite imagery such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. We use a recently published dataset which combined satellite imagery, vessel GPS data and deep-learning models to map industrial fishing vessel across the world's coastal waters from 2017 to 2021. Using AIS and satellite imagery, the authors matched AIS detections to satellite detections when possible (publicly tracked fishing vessels), and, if a satellite detection was unmatched to AIS, then the fishing vessel is considered as untracked [@paolo2024satellite]. We keep only untracked fishing vessels in 2021 and, for each grid cell, calculate the presence of untracked fishing vessels and the number of untracked fishing vessel. We select only fishing vessels with a probability of 80% or higher of being a fishing vessel according to the classification algorithm, and select only fishing vessels between 15 and 145m long.

### Marine Artificial Structures

In order to standardize the detection of marine artificial structures (MAS), we used the same dataset as previously described which also detect offshore structures through satellite imagery. The detected MAS were then classified as wind infrastructures, oil infrastructures, and other infrastructures (such as piers, power lines and aquaculture). In each grid cell, we calculate the presence of MAS, the total number of MAS and then the number of each type of structure (oil, wind and other).

### Dredging and aggregate extraction

```{r, echo = F, results = F, message = F}
source("R/load_aggregate.R")
aggregate <- load_aggregate() 

source("R/load_dredge.R")
dredge <- load_dredge()
```

Aggregate extraction refers to the process of extracting marine sediment such as sand, gravel, and other aggregates from the seabed or coastal areas. These materials are used for various construction purposes, beach nourishment, or agronomics. The extraction process typically involves dredging or suctioning aggregates from the seabed using specialized vessels or equipment. These materials are then transported to shore for processing and distribution.

Marine dredging specifically refers to the process of excavating and removing sediments, sand, gravel, or other materials from the bottom of bodies of water such as oceans, seas, estuaries, and coastal areas.

For aggregate extraction, we used the dataset created in 2014 for the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet).It is the result of the aggregation and harmonization of datasets provided by several sources from all across the EU, and is available for viewing and download on EMODnet web portal (Human Activities, <https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en/human-activities>). The dataset contains points representing aggregate extraction sites in the following countries: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands. Therefore, data for Malta, Greece, Cyprus, Croatia, Slovenia, Latvia and Estonia are potentially missing in our study. In the 2023 update, extraction data until 2022 and new areas have been included. Seeing as aggregate extraction refers to a specific point in time, for points which fall inside an MPA we only kept aggregate extractions occurring after the MPA's creation year. A total of `r nrow(aggregate)` aggregate extraction sites were included

For dredging, we used the dataset created in 2014 for the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet). It is the result of the aggregation and harmonization of datasets provided by several sources from all across the European countries. It is available for viewing and download on EMODnet web portal (Human Activities, <https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en/human-activities>). The dataset contains points representing dredging sites in the following countries: Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and The Netherlands. The main purposes of dredging included in this dataset are: (1) Maintenance dredging, meaning the periodic removal of sediment, debris, or other materials from waterways, ports, harbors, or other navigational channels to ensure safe and efficient passage for vessels, (2) capital dredging refers to the excavation and removal of sediments, rocks, or other materials from water bodies to create new or deepen existing waterways, ports, harbors, or other marine infrastructure, (3) environmental dredging involves the removal of contaminated sediments, pollutants, or hazardous materials from water bodies as part of environmental remediation efforts, (4) cable or pipeline, which involves excavating trenches or removing sediments to lay underwater cables, pipelines, or other submerged infrastructure for telecommunications, energy transmission, or other purposes. Seeing as capital, environmental and cable or pipeline dredging are mainly punctual operations, we only keep dredging operations made for maintenance. A total of `r nrow(dredge)` dredging sites were included.

Both techniques are highly damaging to seabed ecosystems and on marine biodiversity [@newell1998impact; @thrush2002disturbance; @tillin2011direct; @todd2015review; @erftemeijer2012environmental]. Seeing as the impacts of both techniques are similar, we combine both techniques in the final pressures data frame.

### Desalination plants

```{r, echo = F, results = F, message = F}
source("R/load_desalination.R")
desalination <- load_desalination()
```

Desalination plants are facilities specifically designed to convert seawater into freshwater by removing salt and other impurities. During the process, the concentrated brine generated during the desalination process is discharged back into the ocean and can have negative impacts on marine ecosystems [@roberts2010impacts]. We used the database on desalination plants from the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet). The dataset provides spatial information (point) on the centroid of the municipality where a given plant is located. It is available for viewing and download on EMODnet - Human Activities web portal (www.emodnet-humanactivities.eu) and is updated every year. The dataset covers the following countries: Albania, Austria, Belgium, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Guernsey, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Jersey, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK, Ukraine. We only use desalination plants using seawater and located directly on the coastline. A total of `r nrow(desalination)`plants were selected.

### Maritime ports

For maritime ports, we use the World Port Index, showing the location, characteristics, facilities, and services offered by major ports around the world (<https://msi.nga.mil/Publications/WPI>). In each grid cell, we calculate the presence of ports and the number of ports.
